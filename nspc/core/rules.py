=====================================================================
The G2P compiler: Devanagari word -> canonical phone tokens (Phase 1).

It combines:
  (1) orthographic pre-normalization + tag inference  (normalize.py)
  (2) the Unified Priority Rule U5 for final-schwa    (port of u5_reference)
  (3) principled segmental realization:
        - single consonant -> token (+ inherent /a/ unless dead)
        - virama conjunct clusters -> mapped via CLUSTER_MAP (क्ष, त्र, ज्ञ, ...)
        - matras -> vowels
        - anusvara/chandrabindu -> nasalization
  (4) deterministic trace (SPEC §12)

The validated core is the final-schwa decision (U5). Segmental mapping here
is the principled, 1:1-with-orthography realization; it is NOT a black box.
Every step is logged in the trace.

All output tokens are canonical (inventory.py). Adapters translate later.
